# Clinic_Management_System
This project is a booking management system which includes 3 users which are admin, doctors and patients. The main purpose of the project is for patient to make a booking with the doctors in a clinic to save time because most of the time we go to the clinic and have to wait a long line especially during the weekend or the worst part is the doctor is on leave so they have wasted their time and energy coming to the clinic.
